1. ABOUT
====================================================================================

	Markovsky is a continuation on the SeeBorg project written by Eugene 'HMage' Bujak.
	This project was started due to the lack of continued development of the existing
	SeeBorg project. I personally love and enjoy this bot greatly and wanted to see it
	continue and grow.
	
	Markovsky is a random phrase bot that will sit on IRC channel, learning words,
	and periodically (configurable) replying with something that doesn't make
	much sense at all, but sometimes it's at least funny.
	
	It can learn in any language, not just english, but for better character
	processing (like case conversion), you will need to set appropriately
	your system locale.
	
	It uses BotNet library written by Christophe 'CALMEJANE' to connect and
	interact with IRC servers. The library is included in the tarball.


2. COMPILING
====================================================================================

	1. Quick and Dirty
		$ ./configure
		$ make

	2. Explanation
	
	To compile you must need to run ./configure to generate a Makefile. Once this
	is done you can read the Makefiles and make any changes required, then type `make'
	and fix the errors which will be displayed, if any. Markovsky is in a very early
	stage of development and probably won't work on all platforms. If you encounter
	any problems please open a ticket at our project website:

	https://github.com/Mego/Markovsky/issues
	
	After running make, you'll end up with two executables - markovsky-irc and
	markovsky-linein, that is, the markovsky that communicates on IRC or linein.
	The linein is useful for offline chat with the bot and to test the
	modifications done to the dictionary.


3. RUNNING
====================================================================================

	Without any parameters, markovsky-irc reads configuration from markovsky-irc.cfg
	located in current working directory. If it doesn't exist, it will create one
	and terminate, suggesting you to inspect the config file, that's a good idea.
	
	
	Config settings:
	----------------
	server         - server to connect to (default: none)
	serverport     - port of the server to connect to (default: 6667)
	nickname       - nickname (default: Markovsky)
	username       - username (default: Markovsky)
	realname       - realname (default: I am a Markovsky bot)
	quitmessage    - quit message (default: This concludes our irregularly scheduled test, thank you.)
	learning       - '1' if learning new words is enabled, '0' if disabled
	                 (default: 1)
	
	replyrate      - Bot's general reply rate, in percent (default: 1)
	replynick      - Bot's reply rate to his nickname, in percent (default: 33)
	replymagic     - Bot's reply rate to magic words set in 'magicwords',
	                 in percent (default: 33)
	autosaveperiod - Autosave period, in seconds (default: 600)
	channels       - Space separated channel list to autojoin on connect
	                 (default: #test #markovsky)
	magicwords     - Space separated magic word list to reply to according to
	                 replymagic value, useful if bot has alternative nicknames,
	                 like russian. (no default)
	owners         - Space separated bot owners' nickname list, the owner's
	                 hostname will be locked after each bot restart. (no default)
	ignore         - Space separated list of names the bot will ignore and not
        	         record to the chat log index

4. PORTABILITY
====================================================================================

	Markovsky compiles succesfully with GCC v4.3.3 on Linux 2.6.x (32/64bit) but has not
	been tested on other platforms.
	
	SeeBorg compiles succesfully with v2.95.3, GCC v3.2, GCC v3.2.2 and MSVC v6.0.
	Tested succesfully on Linux 2.6.x, Linux 2.4.x, FreeBSD 4.6.2, mingw32 and Win32.
	
	I see no reason why it shouldn't compile and run on any other platform
	that is supported by botnet library and supports standard C++.
	
	If compiling under mingw32 and cygwin, you would want to change the 
	"markovsky_irc_LDFLAGS =  -lpthread" and remove "-lpthread" instead
	replacing it with "-lwsock32".
